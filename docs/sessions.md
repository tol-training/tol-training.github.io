## Planned Sessions

Scheduled sessions are now open for registration. New sessions and repeated sessions will be added to this page, so please keep checking back or [sign up](signup.md) to be emailed when new/repeat sessions become available.

Detailed session contents will be added over time at this site. Instructions for joining each session will be sent to registered participants.

If there are 2 time slots available for a session, pick the one you can attend more conveniently [in your time zone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingtime.html?iso=20230915&p1=224&p2=41&p3=45&p4=4&p5=37&p6=170&p7=176&p8=33&p9=240&p10=22){: target="_blank"}.

    **2023-08-07 Update**  
    The response to BGA23 has been OVERWHELMING! Thank you 🙏 **691 booked, 424 waitlisted** 🤯 Please keep signing up below as we are working with session leaders to add more slots (adding sessions, increasing slots per session, offering recordings with discord discussions, etc). Booked out sessions have a "Join Waitlist" button. Also do **[subscribe/follow](signup.md)** to be the first to be informed when slots open.

    **2023-08-11 Update**  
    We are notifying waitlisted participants today by email on how to book extra slots. If you have a confirmed slot already that you can no longer attend, please email tol-training at sanger.ac.uk with your order details so we can free up your slot for other waitlisted participants. Thank you!

    Sessions added/changed:

    **2023-08-14 Update**  
    We are up to **1167 sign ups and 793 waitlisted slots**!
    
    Seeing the huge demand, some session leaders have very kindly offered webinar slots (view only + text discussions) for:

    - Assembling Genomes with the VGP-Galaxy Pipeline
    - Classifying Transposable Elements with Earl Grey TE
    - Assess genome assemblies with Merqury
    - Annotating genomes the Ensembl way - General concepts + Case study

    We are up to **1475 sign ups and 1018 waitlisted slots**!

    All waitlisted slots as of 4pm UTC should have received information about additional slots. After this point, the only free slots are likely to be from cancellations. A couple of new topics may be added, but no additional slots are likely to be opened for existing topics.

    To be fair to everyone, we will be asking everyone to confirm attendance for each session by next week, so please keep an eye out for those emails.

    Sessions added/changed:

    - "Pangenome Assembly and Assessment using Minigraph and Bandage" new session added 21 Sep 20:00-22:00

    **2023-09-04 Update**  
    Thank you to everyone who attended the first session this morning and kicked off BGA23! Unfortunately (but luckily for the session attendees), five minutes after the session ended, the datacentre that hosts both [BlobToolKit](https://blobtoolkit.genomehubs.org) and [GoaT](https://goat.genomehubs.org) had a major cooling problem and all servers had to be shut down. We don't know when the servers will be back up, so we have postponed both sessions for now, and sent emails to all attendees.

    Sessions added/changed:

    - BlobToolKit: OLD TIME 4 Sep 20:00-21:00, **NEW TIME 11 Sep 17:00-18:00**
    - GoaT: OLD TIME 6 Sep 16:00-18:00, **NEW TIME 25 Sep 15:00-17:00**
    - "Aligning whole genomes using Cactus" new session added 29 Sep 16:00-18:00
