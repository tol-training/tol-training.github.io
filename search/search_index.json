Yes, bioinformatics tool and resource developers as well as Earth Biogenome Project (EBP) members worldwide are volunteering their time in the spirit of the EBP.</p> <p>How long will a session be? Typically 1 hour, but a few may be 2 hours.</p> <p>Do I need to attend all sessions? No, you can attend as many sessions as you like.</p> <p>Sounds great! Where do I register? Registrations are now open (as of 28th July, 2023) at BGA23.org/sessions so bookmark this site, follow our socials, or sign up for our mailing list to be the first to be informed when more sessions are added. Register</p> <p>Will registration be restricted? Yes, because we aim to have highly interactive sessions. We are aiming for ~30 participants per session. If many more people are interested in a particular session, session leaders may choose to offer a webinar format where participant inputs are limited to text, rather than audio and video.</p> <p>Will you use Zoom or Teams or Meet or...? We will be using Zoom and will provide all details closer to the event to registered participants.</p> <p>How will the community exist outside of the sessions? We will encourage participants to sign up to and use the existing community platforms for each tool. For the live sessions we will use Discord for synchronous discussions and will provide all details on registration as above.</p> <p>Will I need a powerful computer to participate? No, all you will need are a desktop browser and a GitHub account, as we will use Gitpod.io for sessions that need a linux command line.</p> <p>Will sessions be spread/repeated across time zones? Yes, sessions will be repeated at least once across time zones, either live or as a recording (with the opportunity to ask additional questions)</p> <p>Will there be assessment/self-assessment? No, these are not formal courses. They are opportunities to learn from the developers and experts in an informal and interactive setting.</p> <p>Do I get a certificate? No. See above.</p> <p>Who is organising this? The Tree of Life Programme at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridge, UK is the main host of Biodiversity Genomics Academy 2023.

The response so far has been overwhelming - 690 slots booked, 420 slots waitlisted, from every continent!</p> <p>I think this is a GREAT problem to have as it means a large and diverse group of people from around the world is really interested in this field.</p> <p>A small number of the booked slots are likely to be pre-emptive sign-ups as these are free sessions, and they might drop out when we ask them to confirm their attendance. However, there is more than a month to go, and we will definitely garner more interest and more waitlist requests.</p> <p>I've been thinking about ways to reduce our current (and future) waitlists and accommodate as many participants as possible. My ideas are listed below with longer explanations of each option at the end of this email</p> <p><ol> <li>Do nothing</li> <li>Increase the capacity of your live zoom meeting sessions</li> <li>Add on a no-limit webinar component to your live session</li> <li>Replace one or more of your live sessions by a webinar</li> <li>Respond in text to a recorded session (in addition to your live session)</li> <li>Add another live session</li> </ol></p> <p>Please choose one or more of these options by the end of Tuesday Aug 8 in your time zone if possible. Do let me know if you have any questions or other suggestions.</p> <p>0. Do nothing. The waitlisted participants will get a chance to join your session if anyone else drops out or does not confirm their place.</p> <p>1. Increase the capacity of your live zoom meeting sessions (currently 30) to, say, 50. Disadvantages: This may reduce interactivity in a zoom meeting format, and will make hands-on exercises a bit more time consuming (although I will be on hand to help participants with basics like command line typos, being in the wrong directory, etc).</p> <p>2. Add on a no-limit webinar component to your live session - current registered participants will still have an interactive zoom meeting experience where they can raise their hand to ask questions, have a discussion with the session leaders, etc. However, the additional participants will get to experience it like a webinar - they can watch a stream of you presenting, and can follow along with the exercises on their own, but the only interactivity is on text. I will be monitoring the text discourse and will flag any questions to you. Our webinar license is for 1000 people but we anticipate ~100 people at most.</p> <p>3. Replace one or more of your live sessions completely by the webinar format (above). The advantage is that we have to only think of one kind of audience. The disadvantage is that we lose out on the interaction energy of 30 (or 50) live participants.</p> <p>4. Respond in text to a recorded session (in addition to your live session). Conduct your live session as planned, which we will record and make available to everyone. Then choose a day when you are relatively free for text discussions. All we ask is that you commit to checking a Discord channel (which is like a Slack channel) 2 or 3 times that day and address the queries that crop up there, in an asynchronous format. Again, I will be around to help triage questions and topics. We were going to ask you to do this anyway if you weren't able to conduct a second live session in a different time zone.</p> <p>5. Add another live session. We are hugely grateful if you\u2019re already doing a second live session. If you aren\u2019t, then we\u2019d love it if you would consider another session (but would completely understand if you don\u2019t have the time for it).

Set up GitPod","text":"<p>If your session requires linux command line access. I will help create a .gitpod.yml in the repo, which will allow users to start a server with software already installed and example files ready to go</p> <p>For example, for BlobToolKit, I created a .gitpod.yml file for installing the dependencies (conda) and pip installing the code, and also added code for starting the docker containers for the API and viewer, which is also nice for end users as they can see what they need to do on their own desktops/HPC server accounts.</p> <p>To try it out:</p> <ul> <li>Click on https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/bgacademy23/blobtoolkit</li> <li>It will ask you to sign in using GitHub, and for permission to create a gitpod account using your github credentials (this is safe, it asks for read-only access to your GitHub public profile)</li> <li>Then it will ask you to launch a workspace (defaults are fine)</li> <li>The workspace should take less than a minute to start and will give you a command prompt, where you can run the <code>blobtools</code> command to see that everything is installed.</li> </ul> <p>The longest time in any hands-on bioinformatics training/demo session is often installing software, or even getting people to ssh into custom servers which takes some set up - and is not as useful to the end users because it may not reflect their lack of root access on an HPC/workstation set up. The advantage with gitpod is that people can start the session right away in a browser, AND they can see all the steps that were used to set up the machine. I try to do everything in user space without requiring root access (though of course gitpod machines allow you to be root), so that participants can copy the instructions for installing software on a cluster</p> <p>The other big advantage is that we don't have to set up the accounts / logins. ANYONE with a Github account can sign up and get 50 hours of free running time on their servers, which should be more than enough for 25 training sessions.</p> <p>I will be on hand to create a .gitpod.yml for your session, which you are obviously free to use in all future training materials as well.</p>"},{"location":"session-leaders-20230909/#4-repeat-session-in-progress","title":"4.
